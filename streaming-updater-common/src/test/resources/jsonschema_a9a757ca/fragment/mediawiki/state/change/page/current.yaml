title: fragment/mediawiki/state/change/page

description: >
  Fragment that represents a MediaWiki page state change in a changelog.
  This schema can be used in multiple 'enriched' versions of page state changes.
  E.g., there could be a 'page_change_with_rendered_content'
  schema that adds fields necessary for representing a change to rendered page content.
  Because we want this to be reusable, this schema does not attempt to represent
  revision content (or MCR content 'slots').  If content info is needed, you should
  add those fields to concrete schema yourself.
  See the non-fragment mediawiki/page/change schema for working example.

    description: >
      Page entity that was created at the old title during a page move.
      This is only set for page move events.
      Note that the created_redirect_page will also have its
      own associated page create event.

              NOTE: prior_state.page.revision_count is unlikely to be set, as

  revision_count:
    description: >
      The number of revisions of this page at the time of this event.
      During a delete, this number of revisions will be archived.
      This field is likely only set for page delete events, as getting
      this information on all events is expensive.
