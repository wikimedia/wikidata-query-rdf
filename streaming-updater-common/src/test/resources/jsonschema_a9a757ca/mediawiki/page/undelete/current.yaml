        description: >
          The prior state of the entity before this event. If a top level entity
          field is not present in this object, then its value has not changed
          since the prior event.  If prior_state itself is not present, then
          this event had no relevant prior state, indicating that it is probably
          the first time this type has been emitted for this entity.
          For page undeletes, prior_state will be absent unless the page_id is no
          longer the same as the page_id it had before it was deleted.
