# schemas-event-primary Snapshot

The files in `jsonschema_a9a757ca` are a copy of the subdirectory by the same name from the
[schemas-event-primary repo](https://gitlab.wikimedia.org/repos/data-engineering/schemas-event-primary)
which contains the JSON schema for Wikimedia & MediaWiki event data. The appended git commit hash helps
to identify the state of the clone.

These files were cloned in order to prevent unnecessary network requests during test execution which could
brick the build during pipeline runs with restricted network access.
